## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

```js
Learnt how to open a link in a new tab with javascript:
    function NewTab() {
      window.open("https://www.frontendmentor.io/", "_blank");
    }
}
```

### Continued development

On hover of the card, I want the parent element background to blur out, narrowing the users focus to the card itself.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Scan](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - This helped me by providing me with ready-made drop-shadow options to pick from.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_open.asp) - This is an amazing resource which helped me understand how to open a link in a new tab with JS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
